# Repository for Algorithms and Projects in CS50
## Lecture 0
I followed the lecturer's examples for Bredth First and Depth First Search Algorithms. The lecturer breifly talked about greedy search algorithms, so I decided to write them myself. Inside the Lecture 0 folder, there's a maze.py that contains Bredth First and Depth First Search Algorithms along with A* and Dijkstra's Algorithms.
